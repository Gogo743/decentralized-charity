  This is a starter-kit for creating a <strong>dApp</strong> on the <strong>nOS</strong> platform
</p>


## Purpose
The goal of this project is to provide a dApp by which people who make donations keep control over their donations. People can vote for or against suggestions
of an organisation to spend money on.
